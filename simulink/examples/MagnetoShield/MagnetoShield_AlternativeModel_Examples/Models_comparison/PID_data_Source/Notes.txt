This program has been used for validation activities to find out
which one of the proposed models in the MagnetoShiel project is
more suitable for the system.
Program uses PID regulator to collect data for comparison of the 
models.
Used sampling period is Ts=0.0015 s
Experiment has been executed on Arduino DUE board.
