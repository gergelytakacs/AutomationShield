%   MAGNETOSHIELD OCTAVE MINIMAL COMMUNICATION SPEED TEST
%
%   This example tests for the absolute minimal sampling period that is 
%   achievable with this shield using Octave. You will need to install the
%   "arduino" package (see pkg) then the script loads it. Although it is possible to
%   override default I2C speeds, tests show no improvement with increased
%   I2C communication speeds. AVR-based Arduinos, such as the UNO will
%   provide the same speed, as the architecture and clock speed is
%   identical in all of them. Due or other non-AVR boards compatible with 
%   the MagnetoShield are not supported. The script just tests reading the
%   analog input and sending data to the I2C bus without attempting feedback 
%   control, as these are the most essential operations required for control.
